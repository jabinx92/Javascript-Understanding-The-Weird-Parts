// function b () {
//     console.log('Called b!');

// console.log(a);
// var a = 'Hello World';
// console.log(a);


// a = undefined; //never DO THIS

// if (a === undefined) {

//general rule of thumb is to have your functions above before running




//everytime a function is called, a new execution context is created on top of that stack

/* Everytime the lectures go, the instructor will pause and mention a "Big word alert". Explaining the word. Show how the word is used. It is just vocabulary

/**
 * Conceptual Aside
 */

/* 
Syntax parsers - a program that reads your code and detemines what it does and if its grammar is valid. - Your code isn't magic, Someone else wrote a program to translate it for the computer.

Lexical enviroment - where something sits physically in the code you write. "Lexical" means having to do with words or grammar. A lexical enviroment exists in programming languages in which where you write something is important.

Execution context - a wrapper to help manage the code that is running. There are lots of lexical environments. Which one is currently running is managed via execution contexts. It can contain things beyond what you've written in your code.

Name/Value Pair: A name which maps to a unique value. The name may be defined more than once, but only can have one value in any given context. That value may be more name/value pairs.

Address = '100 Main St.' Address is the name, value is the street.

Objection: a collection of name value pairs. Most simple definition when talking about javascript.


Global - NOT inside a function

Javascript and undefined

Initially Hoisting has variable setup to undefined, and function setup

Execution context -
phase 1 - creation phase
phase 2 - execution phase

Single Threaded - synchronous execution
one command at a time, under the hood of the browser, maybe not. One at a time in order

Function invocation and the execution stack
Invocation - running or calling a function. In javascript, we invoke by using parenthesis();
*/

//invoking functions

// function b() {

// };

// function a() {
//     b();
// }

// a();

//Functions, context, and variable environments variable environment - where the variables live and how they relate to each other in memory, JUST think about where is the variable

// function b() {
//     var myVar;
//     console.log(myVar);
// }

// function a() {
//     var myVar = 2;
//     console.log(myVar);
//     b();
// }

// var myVar = 1;
// console.log(myVar);
// a();
// console.log(myVar);

// //The scope chain


function a() {

    function b() {
        console.log(myVar);
    }
    var myVar = 2;
    // b();
}


var myVar = 1;
// a();

//scope - where a variable is available in your code, and if it's truly the same variable, or a new copy

//let in es6 allows to users to use block scoping

// if (a > b) {
//     let c = true;
// }

//Asynchronous callbacks - more than one at a time
//what happens in javascript engine is synchronous, when you do a clikc function, that is asynchronous and the javascript file is still running simultaneosly

//in javascript you havae your execution context, then you have your event queue - when you click something to do something. or http request
//event queue is ran after the execution stack is EMPTY!

//asynchronous - multiple actions per time
//long running function
function waitThreeSeconds() {
    var ms = 1000 + new Date().getTime();
    while(new Date() < ms){}
    console.log('finished function');
}

function clickHandler() {
    console.log('click event!');
}

//listen for the click event
document.addEventListener('click', clickHandler);

waitThreeSeconds();
console.log('finished execution');

//in the example above, all the execution context functions run first, then the click in the queue stack gets ran after all the functions in execution contents run

//types and javascript - dynamic typing- you don't tell the engine what type of data a variable holds, it figures it out while your code is running. cariables can hold different types of values because it's all figured out during execution

//static typing 
// bool isNew = 'hello'; // an error

//dynamic typing
var isNew = true;// no error
isNew = 'yup!';
isNew = 1;

//primitive types - a type of data that represents a single value, that is, not an object

//undefined represents lack of existence(you shouldn't set a variable to this)

//null represents lack of existence(you can set a variable to this)

//boolean - true or false

//number - floating point number(there's always some decimals). unlike other programming lanaguages, there's only one 'number' type... and it can make math weird.

//string - a sequence of characters(both '' and "" can be used)

//symbol - used in es6(next version in javascript) not much talked here about this.

//operators - a special function  that is syntactically (written) differently, generally, operators take two parameters and return one result

var a = 3 + 4;
console.log(a);

// function +(a, b) {

//     return // add the two #s
// }

var a = 4 - 3;
console.log(a);

var a = 4 > 3;
console.log(a);

//operator precendence and associativity - which operator function gets called first
//functions are called in order of precedence(HIGHER precedence wins)
//associativity - what order operator functions get called in : left-to-right or right-to-left
//when functions have the same precedence

var a = 3 + 4 * 5;
console.log(a);

var a = 2, b = 3, c = 4;
a = b = c; // a = b = c = 4 // a = b = 4 // a = 4;
console.log(a);
console.log(b);
console.log(c);
//They all equal 4 because the associativity is right-to-left. It starts at the right then goes left

//( ... ) always get highest precedence first with a level of 19, the highest number on the chart
var a = (3 + 4) * 5;
console.log(a);
